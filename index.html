							## Getting Started in Python

							CircuitPython and MicroPython
							
							---
							
							**Python** is a **programming language**
							
							Python is one of the easier languages to start with. It tends to be used most where programming is a tool, rather than for writing large programs like operating systems.
							
							------
							
							We're using **MicroPython** and **CircuitPython** in this class.
							
							These are scaled back versions of Python that can run on smaller, weaker hardware. They're not identical, but similar enough that it won't make a difference right now
							
							---
							
							## Concepts and Vocabulary
							
							------
							
							### [Reference](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/)
							
							A document containing information about the programming language
							
							------
							
							### Syntax
							
							The grammar of a programming language. Unlike your English teacher, Python doesn't understand what you mean if you write it wrong
							
							------
							
							### Comments
							
							Text that the computer will ignore. In Python, these start with `#`. We use these to make code easier for humans to understand. We can also temporarily deactivate bits of code this way.
							
							------
							
							### Libraries/Modules
							
							Additional bundles of programming functions that we can add to our code
							
							------
							
							### Import statements
							
							The way we add libraries/modules to our code
							
							------
							
							### Dot notation
							
							A way of indicating hierarchy (which items are 'inside' other items). For instance, `Animal.cat` would refer to the 'cat' item within the 'Animal' category
							
							------
							
							### Functions
							
							Actions the programming language understands how to do. Can be built in, acquired from libraries/modules, or written by the programmer
							
							------
							
							### Parameters/arguments
							
							Additional information you give to a function
							
							------
							
							### Blocks of code
							
							A way of using indentation (or curly brackets in many languages) to show that certain code is conditional on a line at the top, or 'belongs' to it
							
							---
							
							# Hello World
							
							------
							
							For the Chromebook, you can use the [browser-based editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/2)
							
							```python
							# import all microbit modules
							from microbit import *
							
							# scroll 'hello world' on the display
							display.scroll("Hello World")

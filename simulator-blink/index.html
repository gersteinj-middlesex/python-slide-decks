						## CircuitPython

						Simulation and the Raspberry Pi Pico

						---

						For today, we'll be using the [CircuitPython Simulator](https://wokwi.com/arduino/new?template=circuitpython-pi-pico) to get started

						---
						
						### Hello World

						This is a simple program to blink an LED. We'll go through it together.

						```python
						# import necessary packages
						import board
						import digitalio
						import time

						# create an i/o object using the board's LED
						led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
						# set the i/o object to be an OUTPUT
						led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

						# loop forever
						while True:
						# if the LED's value is True, it will be on
						# if the LED's value is False, it will be off
						# Why do you think this blinks?
						led.value = True
						time.sleep(.5)
						led.value = False
						time.sleep(1)
						```
						---

						### Imports

						```python
						import board
						import digitalio
						import time
						```

						You'll use these three modules almost all the time. These will let you access the different parts of the board, create and use inputs and outputs, and work with time

						---

						### REPL

						We're going to take a look at the parts of the board, and with it, the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). It's the black terminal window in the bottom right

						---

						### REPL

						To access the REPL, click in the black terminal window and use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to stop the code and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> to reboot. Then press any key to enter the REPL. You should see something like this:
						```
						Adafruit CircuitPython 7.0.0-rc.1-81-g8520c430a on 2021-09-14; Raspberry Pi Pico with rp2040
						>>> 
						>>> 
						```
						
						From here, you can use your board interactively!

						---

						### REPL

						The REPL will accept a line of code from you and evaluate it *immediately*. After evaluating the code, it will you the value of whatever it just evaluated. Try typing things in and pressing enter. Can you do math in here?

						---
						
						### REPL

						Let's look at the `dir()` function. When it's used, you'll need an *argument* - whatever you want to list the contents of.
						It wlil return the contents of that object.

						1. Import the board module. It will stay imported until you reset the board you're using

						`import board`

						2. Use `dir()` as shown below. What do you get?

						`dir(board)`
						
						---

						### REPL/dir()

						```
						>>> dir(board)
						['__class__', '__name__', 'A0', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'GP0', 'GP1', 'GP10', 'GP11', 
						'GP12', 'GP13', 'GP14', 'GP15', 'GP16', 'GP17', 'GP18', 'GP19', 'GP2', 'GP20', 
						'GP21', 'GP22', 'GP23', 'GP24', 'GP25', 'GP26', 'GP26_A0', 'GP27', 'GP27_A1', 
						'GP28', 'GP28_A2', 'GP3', 'GP4', 'GP5', 'GP6', 'GP7', 'GP8', 'GP9', 'LED', 
						'SMPS_MODE', 'VBUS_SENSE', 'VOLTAGE_MONITOR', 'board_id']
						>>> 
						```
						
						Can you find something in there about an LED?

						---

						### Setting up a digital IO pin

						Digital IO: Digital input and output. This is a pin that we can send a signal to or get a signal from. If we want to turn the built in LED on and off, we need to be able to make it an *output* and control the value.

						```python
						# create an i/o object using the board's LED
						led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
						# set the i/o object to be an OUTPUT
						led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
						```
						
						---
						
						```python
						# create an i/o object using the board's LED
						led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
						# set the i/o object to be an OUTPUT
						led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
						```

						Any LED or other digital output will generally follow this template. You'll change the name of the variable (`led` here) and you'll change the pin (`board.LED`) here, but pretty much everything else will be the same.

						---

						### Controlling the LED

						```python
						while True:
							led.value = True
							time.sleep(.5)
							led.value = False
							time.sleep(1)
						```

						`led.value` is a property of that `led` variable we created before. as you learn more, I'll explain how that happens. It's a boolean value. What are the possible values? Howdoes that control the LED?

						---

						### Try It

						Create your own blink pattern!
